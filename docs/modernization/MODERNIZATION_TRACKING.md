## 2025-09-17: Documentation Review and Updates for Dependency/Upgrade Cluster Start

### 1. Reviewed Key Documentation Files
- **Description:** Examined `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `README.rst`, and `docs/modernization/*` for outdated or no longer needed material as part of starting the Dependency/Upgrade Cluster (Python 3.10+, Django 4.2+, Requirements to pyproject.toml/uv, Resolve Dependabot alerts).
- **Findings:**
  - Outdated: References to Python 3.9 in Dockerfile; old cache_from with upstream GHCR (updated to fork/dynamic).
  - Outdated: Docker Hub mentions (removed since switch to GHCR).
  - Outdated: Setup instructions not reflecting unified scripts and GHCR.
  - No longer needed: Some duplicated sections in README.rst (streamlined).
  - Current status: Docs are mostly up to date post-CI/CD work, but needed alignment with GHCR and upgrade plan.
  - Plan: Proceed with dependency upgrades on feature/dependency-upgrade branch, testing incrementally. Resolve 134 vulnerabilities (10 critical first). Update Dockerfile for Python 3.10+, then Django, then requirements system.
- **Rationale:** Ensures documentation reflects current state before major upgrades, preventing confusion during modernization.
- **Files Updated:**
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (marked completed items, noted in-progress cluster)
  - `README.rst` (updated setup, removed outdated refs, added modernization note)
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Revert changes to the above files from git history.

### 2. Comprehensive Upgrade Plan Development (Python 3.12 + Django 5.1)
- **Description:** Developed detailed upgrade strategy targeting Python 3.12.10 + Django 5.1 instead of incremental 3.10 + 4.2 approach. Created comprehensive documentation covering 7 phases with rollback points, risk mitigation, and issue anticipation.
- **Rationale:** Option B (big bang upgrade) addresses more modernization goals simultaneously, provides better long-term positioning (2028+ support), and resolves more Dependabot vulnerabilities in one cycle. Forward-looking approach minimizes future upgrade debt.
- **Strategy Components:**
  - **7-Phase Plan:** Infrastructure → Database → Django Core → Dependencies → Dev Tools → Testing → Cleanup
  - **Risk Mitigation:** Git tags at each phase, comprehensive testing, rollback procedures
  - **Issue Anticipation:** psycopg2→3 migration, admin template changes, DRF compatibility
  - **Success Metrics:** Technical, business, and modernization goals clearly defined
- **Files Created:**
  - `docs/modernization/PYTHON312_DJANGO51_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` (comprehensive strategy)
  - `docs/modernization/UPGRADE_DECISION_MATRIX.md` (quick reference, go/no-go criteria)
- **Todo List:** Created 7-phase structured todo list for progress tracking
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Revert to `pre-dependency-upgrade` tag
  - Delete upgrade plan documents if approach changes
  - Switch to incremental 3.10 + 4.2 approach if needed

### 3. Pre-Upgrade Tagging and Branch Setup
- **Description:** Created `pre-dependency-upgrade` git tag as safety net before beginning major dependency upgrades. Established feature branch `feature/dependency-upgrade` for all upgrade work.
- **Rationale:** Following modernization plan requirement to tag before major changes. Provides clean rollback point if upgrade encounters insurmountable issues.
- **Setup Complete:** Ready to begin Phase 1 (Infrastructure Foundation) of upgrade plan
