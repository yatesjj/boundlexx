## 2025-09-08: Dockerfile EOL Fix and .local.env Recreation

### 1. Debian Buster Archive Fix in Dockerfile (Reapplied)
  - `docker/django/Dockerfile`
  - Remove the `sed` lines that update apt sources to the archive URLs and the apt.conf.d line.

### 2. Recreated .local.env File
  - `.local.env`
  - Delete `.local.env` from the project root.

### 3. Created and Configured docker-compose.override.yml
- **Description:** Added and configured `docker-compose.override.yml` in the project root to enable local environment overrides, port mapping, and volume mounts for Boundless and icon renderer paths. Ensured correct Windows paths and enabled `.local.env` for all relevant services.
- **Rationale:** Required for proper dev container and Docker Compose startup, especially on Windows. Ensures correct service configuration and local development compatibility.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `docker-compose.override.yml`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Delete or rename `docker-compose.override.yml` from the project root, or revert to a previous version if misconfigured.

## 2025-09-10: Container Management Scripts - COMPLETE ✅

### 1. Finalized Container Management System
- **Description:** Implemented complete container management solution with two production-ready scripts: `setup_development_container_improved.py` (main development with dry-run capability) and `setup_test_container.py` (enhanced test environments with automatic folder-based naming). Added `container_status.py` utility. Archived complex parallel testing script to `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/`.
- **Rationale:** Provides clean, maintainable container management following Docker Compose best practices. Enables multi-environment development with automatic prefix detection from parent folder names (e.g., `boundlexx-yatesjj-test-PR3` → auto-detected prefixes). Separates base files (committed) from local customization files. Port 28000 base aligned with upstream repository.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `setup_development_container_improved.py` (production ready with argument parsing)
  - `setup_test_container.py` (FINAL - enhanced with folder-based auto-detection and clean override generation)
  - `container_status.py` (utility for container status checks)
  - `docker-compose.override.example.yml` (enhanced template with all container names)
  - `docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` (comprehensive setup documentation)
  - `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/run_for_parallel_test_containers.py` (archived for reference)
  - README.rst (updated with correct 28000 port base)
- **Architecture Implemented:**
  - **Base files (committed):** `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `docker-compose.override.example.yml`
  - **Local files (personal):** `docker-compose.override.yml`, `.local.env`
  - **Setup process:** Copy template files, run setup script with automatic prefix detection
  - **Multi-environment support:** Different folder names create different container prefixes
  - **Port strategy:** 28000 base for development, +1 offset for test environments (Django: 28001, others internal)
- **Enhanced Test Container Features:**
  - Automatic folder-based prefix detection from parent directory
  - Clean override file generation instead of regex modifications
  - Configurable port offsets (default: +1 for Django, others internal)
  - Dry-run capability for safe preview before implementation
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Delete production scripts: `setup_development_container_improved.py`, `setup_test_container.py`, `container_status.py`
  - Restore archived script from `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/` if needed
  - Revert changes to `docker-compose.override.example.yml` and documentation files
  - Remove `docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` and related documentation
- **Testing Workflow Established:**
  - Clone to separate test location (e.g., `C:\VSCode\boundlexx-test-1\boundlexx`)
  - Use `setup_test_container.py` for port-offset test environments (28000→28001)
  - Automatic container prefixing prevents conflicts with main development
  - Complete isolation enables safe testing without affecting production data
  - Documented in `docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` and README.rst

## 2025-09-11: Documentation Consolidation and Cleanup

### 1. Archived Outdated Documentation
- **Description:** Moved outdated container management docs to `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/docs/` and consolidated all technical information into a single comprehensive guide.
- **Rationale:** Multiple overlapping docs created inconsistencies and maintenance burden. Consolidation ensures single source of truth and reduces errors.
- **Files Archived:**
  - `docs/modernization/CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT.md` → `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/docs/CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT.md`
  - `docs/modernization/DEV_CONTAINER_CHANGELOG.md` → `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/docs/DEV_CONTAINER_CHANGELOG.md`
- **Files Enhanced:**
  - `README.rst` - Simplified to essential setup instructions with pointer to detailed docs
  - `docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Enhanced as comprehensive technical reference
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated to reflect new documentation structure
- **Documentation Architecture:**
  - **README.rst** - Simple user-facing setup instructions
  - **docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md** - Complete technical guide (single source of truth)
  - **docs/modernization/MODERNIZATION_TRACKING.md** - Project tracking and change log
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Corrected all port offset inconsistencies (+1 for Django, others internal)
  - Updated script names and references throughout
  - Removed duplicated testing workflow sections
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Restore archived files from `docs/modernization/archived_scripts/docs/`
  - Revert README.rst and ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md changes

## 2025-09-08: Project Initialization

### 1. Debian Buster Archive Fix in Dockerfile
- **Description:** Updated `docker/django/Dockerfile` to use Debian archive URLs for Buster, resolving apt-get update failures due to EOL repositories.
- **Rationale:** Debian Buster repositories are EOL and moved to archive; this fix restores package installation.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `docker/django/Dockerfile`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Remove the `sed` lines that update apt sources to the archive URLs.

- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Delete `.local.env` from the project root.

### 3. Set Up Local Python Virtual Environment
- **Description:** Added instructions for creating and using a `.venv` for hybrid local + Docker development.
- **Rationale:** Allows safe local development without affecting global Python install.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `SETUP_LOCAL_VENV.md`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Delete `.venv` directory and related instructions if not needed.
