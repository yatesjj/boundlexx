## 2025-09-08: Project Initialization

### 1. Debian Buster Archive Fix in Dockerfile
- **Description:** Updated `docker/django/Dockerfile` to use Debian archive URLs for Buster, resolving apt-get update failures due to EOL repositories.
- **Rationale:** Debian Buster repositories are EOL and moved to archive; this fix restores package installation.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `docker/django/Dockerfile`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Remove the `sed` lines that update apt sources to the archive URLs.

### 2. Created .local.env File
- **Description:** Added `.local.env` to satisfy Docker Compose and dev container requirements for environment variables.
- **Rationale:** Required for container startup and configuration.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `.local.env`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Delete `.local.env` from the project root.

### 3. Set Up Local Python Virtual Environment
- **Description:** Added instructions for creating and using a `.venv` for hybrid local + Docker development.
- **Rationale:** Allows safe local development without affecting global Python install.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `SETUP_LOCAL_VENV.md`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Delete `.venv` directory and related instructions if not needed.

## 2025-09-08: Successful Dev Container Startup

### 4. Verified Dev Container Startup
- **Description:** Successfully started the VS Code dev container after configuring `docker-compose.override.yml` and ensuring all required files and paths were present. Confirmed that the development environment is now operational.
- **Rationale:** Confirms that the modernization and troubleshooting steps were effective and the dev workflow is unblocked.
- **Files Verified:**
  - `docker-compose.override.yml`
  - `.local.env`
  - `docker/django/Dockerfile`
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - If future container startup issues occur, review recent changes to these files and consult previous troubleshooting steps in this log.

## 2025-09-14: Comprehensive Setup Scripts and Environment Files Review - COMPLETE ✅

### 1. Full System Review and Validation
- **Description:** Conducted comprehensive review of all setup scripts, environment files, Docker configurations, and process chains. Validated the entire setup workflow from scripts to running containers.
- **Rationale:** Ensure all components are working correctly, documentation is accurate, and the setup process is reliable for development and testing.
- **Scope:** Reviewed setup_development_container_improved.py, setup_test_container.py, .env, .local.env, docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.override.yml, and all related documentation.

### 2. Setup Scripts Validation ✅
- **setup_development_container_improved.py**: ✅ Logic correct, error handling robust, proper prefix detection
- **setup_test_container.py**: ✅ Clean override generation, port offset handling, auto-startup functionality
- **Process Chain**: ✅ Scripts → File updates → Container launch → Verification works correctly
- **Features**: ✅ Dry-run support, force overwrite, user feedback, validation checks

### 3. Environment Files Corrections ✅
- **Issue Found**: `.local.env` was missing critical sections (Boundless config, Django settings, debugging, etc.)
- **Fix Applied**: Added all missing sections to match `.env` structure perfectly
- **Sections Added**:
  - Boundless Secrets (BOUNDLESS_USERNAMES, BOUNDLESS_PASSWORDS, STEAM_USERNAMES, STEAM_PASSWORDS, etc.)
  - Django settings (DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS, DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, TZ)
  - Debugging settings (REMOTE_DEBUGGING, DJANGO_DEBUG, etc.)
  - Prometheus settings, other secrets, production sections
- **Result**: `.local.env` now complete and functional for all Boundless operations

### 4. Docker Configuration Validation ✅
- **Base Configuration**: `docker-compose.yml` - All services properly defined with correct dependencies
- **Override Configuration**: `docker-compose.override.yml` - Correctly configured for dev environment with:
  - Proper container prefixes (`boundlexx-yatesjj-*`)
  - Correct port mapping (Django: 28000)
  - Network isolation (`boundlexx-yatesjj-network`)
  - Volume mounts for Boundless game data
- **Runtime Status**: All 11 containers running correctly with proper naming

### 5. Documentation Updates ✅
- **README.rst**: Updated with current setup process, correct port information, accurate script usage
- **ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md**: Fixed formatting issues, ensured all instructions current
- **MODERNIZATION_TRACKING.md**: Added this comprehensive review entry
- **Consistency**: Cross-referenced all documentation for accuracy

### 6. Process Chain Validation ✅
- **Setup Flow**: Clone → Copy templates → Run script → Customize → Verify → Use
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Folder-based prefixes working correctly
- **Isolation**: Complete environment separation between dev/test instances
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback throughout process

### 7. Current System Status ✅
- **Containers**: All running with correct names and ports
- **Environment**: Complete and properly configured
- **Scripts**: Production-ready with robust error handling
- **Documentation**: Accurate and up-to-date
- **Process**: Reliable and well-documented

### Files Reviewed/Updated:
- `setup_development_container_improved.py` (validated)
- `setup_test_container.py` (validated)
- `.env` (validated - complete template)
- `.local.env` (fixed - added missing sections)
- `docker-compose.yml` (validated)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (validated - corrected configuration)
- `README.rst` (updated with current information)
- `docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` (fixed formatting and content)
- `docs/modernization/MODERNIZATION_TRACKING.md` (added this entry)

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Setup scripts are well-architected and functioning correctly**
- ✅ **Environment files now complete and properly configured**
- ✅ **Docker configuration optimized for development workflow**
- ✅ **Process chain reliable from setup to running containers**
- ✅ **Documentation accurate and comprehensive**
- ✅ **Multi-environment support working as designed**

### Next Steps:
- Ready for development work
- Can confidently use for Boundless game data ingestion
- All modernization goals for container management achieved

**Status**: All components validated and working correctly. System ready for production development use.

## 2025-09-15: Removal of Legacy Scripts

### 1. Deleted Legacy Scripts
- **Files Removed:**
  - `test_prefix_logic.py`
  - `run_for_parallel_test_containers.py`
- **Rationale:** All prefix logic and parallel test setup is now handled by `setup_test_container.py` and `setup_development_container_improved.py`. These legacy/experimental scripts are obsolete and have been removed from the project root.
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Restore the files from git history if needed for reference.

## 2025-09-17: Documentation Review and Updates for Dependency/Upgrade Cluster Start

### 1. Reviewed Key Documentation Files
- **Description:** Examined `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `README.rst`, and `docs/modernization/*` for outdated or no longer needed material as part of starting the Dependency/Upgrade Cluster (Python 3.10+, Django 4.2+, Requirements to pyproject.toml/uv, Resolve Dependabot alerts).
- **Findings:**
  - Outdated: References to Python 3.9 in Dockerfile; old cache_from with upstream GHCR (updated to fork/dynamic).
  - Outdated: Docker Hub mentions (removed since switch to GHCR).
  - Outdated: Setup instructions not reflecting unified scripts and GHCR.
  - No longer needed: Some duplicated sections in README.rst (streamlined).
  - Current status: Docs are mostly up to date post-CI/CD work, but needed alignment with GHCR and upgrade plan.
  - Plan: Proceed with dependency upgrades on feature/dependency-upgrade branch, testing incrementally. Resolve 134 vulnerabilities (10 critical first). Update Dockerfile for Python 3.10+, then Django, then requirements system.
- **Rationale:** Ensures documentation reflects current state before major upgrades, preventing confusion during modernization.
- **Files Updated:**
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (marked completed items, noted in-progress cluster)
  - `README.rst` (updated setup, removed outdated refs, added modernization note)
- **How to Roll Back:**
  - Revert changes to the above files from git history.
