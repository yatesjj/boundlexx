# Archived Documentation

### `CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT.md` (Archived 2025-09-11)

- **Superseded by**: `docs/modernization/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` (complete technical guide)
- **Issues**: Referenced old script names, wrong ports (8000 vs 28000), archived scripts

### `DEV_CONTAINER_CHANGELOG.md` (Archived 2025-09-11)  
- **Reason**: Duplicated information already tracked in MODERNIZATION_TRACKING.md
