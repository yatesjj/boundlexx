The goal is to modernize the Boundlexx project and correct the Steam Authentication issue.
I would like to fork the Boundlexx project, modernize it according to AngellusMortis instructions and the issues pointed out.
Resolve the Steam authentication issue.
Then I will need to know how to submit the changes to https://github.com/AngellusMortis/boundlexx

Primary Goal: Meet Modernization Expections described by AngellusMortis, get the project to the desired end state.
Next Goal, fix Steam Authentication Issue
Next Goal, cleanup project
